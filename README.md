# Mesh-Data-Insight
Mesh Data Insight a Blender plugin for viewing mesh data. 
Developed as a helper for debugging custom mesh importers.

Usage:
In 3D viewport in properites (by deafult vertical tabs on right) under Misc tab you will find Mesh Info subtab. That's what it ads.
To update selected vertex cords to selection from viewport go to object mode (2 x TAB).

UV cords display only in object mode.
